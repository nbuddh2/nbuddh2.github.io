                <h3>Hello, I am Sairam  </h3><br />
                <p>
                    "Data is the future," is the phrase I live by. I am a freshmen at the MSCS program offered by UIC and I am a Data Science Enthusiast. I have worked for Mahindra finance for six months where my job involved developing AI/ML algorithms to analyze the sustainability of the Mahindra Finance branches.  I have enrolled for the AI, Intro to Machine Learning, and Visual Data Science classes for the Fall 22 semester. I'm thrilled to be a part of this class and can't wait to see what the future holds for me!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>I have participated in several hackathons and even won a handful of them! Aside from academics, I am an avid sports fan! In badminton, I represented my state, and in chess, I represented my college. During my undergraduate studies, I was also the president of the dancing club.Â  </p>
